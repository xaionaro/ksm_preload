Description: Enables legacy applications to leverage Linux's mem-dedup
 Enables legacy applications to leverage Linuxâ€™s memory deduplication.
 If you have multiple processes generating similar data (like multiple
 applications serving different vhosts), this easy to use tool may
 allow you to spare memory by deduplicating it. If two pages (that is
 on, most systems, consecutive blocks of 4k) are identical, they will
 be merged into a single page to reduce memory usage.
